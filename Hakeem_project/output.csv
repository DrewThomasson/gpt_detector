﻿The Devil in the White City and The Clash of the Classes
"The novel “The Devil in the White City'' provides an inanimate and rare glimpse behind the scenes of a historical event. Never before in the United States had something so audacious and frivolous been accomplished. The scale of the project meant that its construction gave birth to elements of change in society. There were changes in and advancements in engineering, evolution of social norms and new forms of economics that grew out of the project. However despite all these aspects of societal progress the most interesting phenomena to be captured in the novel was the relationship between the upper and lower classes during the event. For every grand idea proposed by a politician, engineer or architect, there was a nameless forgotten human being whose actions were essential to the success of the idea."
"Over the course of human history there are people whose ideas change the lives of many and the future forever and people whose lives are dictated by these ideas. There are two types of people whose ideas possess so much influence. The first kind is the innovator. The second kind of person is a person who wields power. The origin of the power can vary greatly, but the ability to influence the actions of many is a force that bends society one way or another. There is a relationship between the two types of people.The relationship between people with power and people with ideas can be described as what it means to be a member of the upper classes of society. The upper class is a mixture of people born with financial power and people who gain it through the quality of their ideas. This group of people has a status above the people who do their bidding in return for financial gain, spiritual satisfaction or fear of consequences. The people who further the interest of the upper class can be defined as the lower classes or the “working” classes of a society."
"The 1893 Chicago World Fair should never have happened from a financial perspective. It was too expensive and outlandish a project to have taken place in the young pragmatic nation of the United State. So how could a project so pointless and too financially risky to be profit driven, be conceived in a place that was not ruled by monarchs or religious leaders? The answer lay in the birth of a new power structure in the “American Gilded Age”. Years of American prosperity had led to the creation of a new ruling class of wealth. So when “officials made it clear that Burham and Root would be the lead designers” (Larson 33) chosen to build the world's most amazing event of all time, it was not due to the natural progress of a nation. An entire artificial economy was created as money was poured into a project that very few Americans actually had the luxury to worry whether it would succeed or fail. The frenzied effort to out do the previous Pairs World Fair could only be driven by the wealthy members of the country who had witnessed it themselves."
"The novel follows the stories of two men, Daniel Burnham and H.H Holmes , both of whom the creation of the fair changed their lives forever. While one man was a self made aristocrat whose obsession led to triumph, the other was a psychopath whose obsession led to tragedy. Despite their differences they were united in the opportunity the fair presented them and in the power it allowed them to wield over people’s lives. While at different levels on the affluent ladder both men were well off enough to control people with the promise of money. While Burnham’s project lured men from across the country to the opportunity of increased wealth, Holme’s project lured women across the country to the prospect of financial and emotional stability. The fair highlighted the vulnerability of those that were financially dependent to those that were financially independent."
"In order to understand the relationship between the working class that built the fair and the “ruling” class that directed its construction we can examine the project of head gardener of the Chicago World Fair. Frederick Olmstead is famous for his agricultural works. His passion for his craft is evident from his letters expressing his frustration with how the Chicago Fair was perverting his artistic vision. The novel explains in great depth how the stress of such an ambitious and  rushed project ate away at Olmsteads mental health and how Burnham had to employ overnight crews to help beautify the park in time for opening. What the book fails to explore is the nature of the men who worked for Olmstead and Burnham. If not his own passion, what could drive a man to partake in back breaking work, overnight and in a torrential downpour? The answer to this question is survival. The working class was willing to endure so much hardship for physical survival while the upper class was motivated by the survival of their ideas."
"The relationship between the men and women who built the fair and the men and women who ordered its construction can be compared to the relationship between the murderer, Holmes, and his victims. Were the workers who built and lost their lives in the city of Chicago and around the construction of the fair any different from the women who built their lives around the psychopath? Holmes victimised dozens of women for his own pleasure and satisfaction while the movers and shakers of the time victimised the working class under the guise of progress and the pursuit of wealth. The fair was after all just like Holme’s murders, brief and no physical evidence of it happening was left behind."
"The stories of labor strikes, demands for minimum wage and better working conditions overshadowed the triumph of such a magnificent accomplishment. In fact “the Fairs capitulation pumped steam into America’s-and Chicago’s- already- boiling labor movement.”(Larson 224)  The filth and squalor of the newborn city was ignored under the pretext of the price of progress. Details such as “A decaying carcass of a horse was spotted bobbing near one of the intake cribs”(Larson 175) provided insight into how even when progress was made to benefit society, such as a water sanitation plant, it was a by-product of more pointless projects. Other details such as the continuous strikes and formation of unions pointed to how the elite abandoned positive incentives for progress when their own status became threatened.The elite feared the embarrassment of failure while the workers feared starvation. Tension was present due to the unequal levels of fear.  Burnham’s obsession with completing the project on time certainly victimized many workers directly and even indictelty in the chaos that surrounded the project."
"The events of “The Devil in the White City'' are examples of the class struggle in modern society.  It highlights how the whims of the powerful can control the lives of the powerless. The story shares insight on how the pursuit of power can lead to both tragedy such as the case of Patrick Eugene Prendergast and triumph such as the case of George Ferris Jr.. Was the devil in the story the depraved Holmes preying on vulnerable women or was it the powerful men, such as Burham, exploiting the lower classes to build a celebration of their excess wealth? It is not necessary to condemn the character of the men and women behind the creation of the fair in order to see how there was an unfair relationship between those that had power and those that did not. Additionally while Burnham receives credit for creating such a momentous project, his success was built on the backs of the thousands of men and women that physically laboured to turn his dream into a reality. The fair itself was an example of the dominance of the powerful few over the powerless many in the context of human history ."
